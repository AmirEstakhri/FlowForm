from flow is a  app where there is a assing site  , what we do here is this , first we have 3  type of user , normal user , manager and admin 

user  cerate a form  
evey user is in a group , where the can send form to the manager of that group , and also if the have sub role for sending the form to other user they can but only if they are  in thee same group as them ,
evey group can only have 1 manager 
users that have the  sub role , can assing other users , but other users can only seee the form and not do any thing els
when the from is send by user , it auto add the date that when the form is sended , and who is the sender
user can edit the form befor it get verifiy , but wheen it gets verifiy, user can not edit it (there is section that user can see how many from is sended byb him and in what stats thee from is )
user can not assing admin, or otheer managers of other parts , he can  only send the form to his manageer 


now for manager part,
manageer can verifiy the from and he can also send the form to other managers or admin if needed for they verifiy also , 
he can assing as many as manager as he want to the from so the can also verifiy the from , and there is a log , for evey verifity on the form , so it tracks when thee from verifyed , by who , and what time 
he can only send the from to admin 

for admin  part, 
admin can do all , cerate user ,edit from , add tags m remove users  , place user and managers in groups , and so on , so admin can do all
